**OPFOR MISSION STATEMENT**: *The mission of OPFOR Battalion is two-fold.*

 *First, as a unit of the Georgia State Defense Force, we provide mission-ready military forces to assist state and local authorities in times of state emergencies (man-made disasters, natural disasters, pandemic), to conduct homeland security and community service activities under the umbrella of Defense Support to Civil Authorities, and to augment the Georgia Air National Guard and Georgia Army National Guard, as required. Second, as the Opposing Force unit, OPFOR provides physically fit and well-trained Soldiers as a force multiplier in the pre-deployment combat tactical training of Georgia Army National Guard Soldiers.*

OPFOR (Opposing Force) Battalion is a special unit tasked with emulating enemy tactics for purposes of military training. In 2018, the GSDF established the OPFOR Battalion to conduct direct support operations to the Georgia Army National Guard during pre-deployment preparation and training. OPFOR Soldiers learn and execute both conventional and irregular warfare and combat tactics. When called upon to conduct training exercises with the Georgia Army National Guard, OPFOR Battalion Soldiers are able to imitate potential enemy tactics at to provide realistic training scenarios for Georgia Army National Guard Soldiers as they prepare for combat zone deployment.

The GSDF is a unarmed component of the Georgia Department of Defense. Weapons are used for training, sanctioned competitions, or other authorized purpose.

OPFOR Battalion Soldiers drill monthly and participate in regular training at armories and military installations throughout Georgia. To simulate conventional and irregular warfare scenarios in potential operational environments, OPFOR Soldiers must be physically fit, mentally strong, and ready and able to deploy at short notice.
