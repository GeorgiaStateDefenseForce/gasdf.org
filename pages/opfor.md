**OPFOR MISSION STATEMENT**: *The mission of OPFOR Battalion is two-fold. First, as a unit of the GSDF, we provide mission-ready military forces to assist state and local authorities in times of state emergencies (man-made disasters, natural disasters, pandemic), to conduct homeland security and community service activities under the umbrella of Defense Support to Civil Authorities, and to augment the Georgia Air National Guard and Georgia Army National Guard, as required. Second, as the Opposing Force unit, OPFOR provides physically fit and well-trained soldiers as a force multiplier in the pre-deployment combat tactical training of Georgia Army National Guard soldiers.*

OPFOR (**OP**posing **FOR**ce) BATTALION is a special unit tasked with emulating enemy tactics for purposes of military training. OPFOR Battalion was established by the Georgia State Defense Force in 2018 to conduct direct support operations to Georgia Army National Guard during pre-deployment preparation and training. OPFOR soldiers learn and execute both traditional and irregular warfare and combat tactics. When called upon to conduct training exercises with the Georgia Army National Guard, OPFOR Battalion soldiers are able to imitate potential enemy tactics at a high level to provide realistic training scenarios for Georgia Army National Guard soldiers as they prepare for international deployment.

OPFOR Battalion soldiers drill monthly and participate in regular training at armories and military installations throughout Georgia. To simulate Conventional and Irregular Warfare scenarios in Potential Operational Environments, OPFOR soldiers have to be physically fit, mentally strong, and be ready and able to deploy at short notice.

Serving in OPFOR Battalion requires a higher than average commitment, with frequent overnight stays in basic outdoor settings and physically challenging military training. Serving in the Georgia State Defense Force OPFOR unit is a privilege and an adventure. OPFOR soldiers are 100% dedicated to supporting the Georgia Army National Guard in its training, missions, and deployments.
