# 1st Brigade

# "Boots on the Ground!"



**Mission**

The 1BDE is the “boots on the ground” for the Georgia State Defense Force. The 1BDE is extensively trained in SAR (search and rescue) and land navigation, having provided skilled assistance to local authorities in their efforts to locate lost persons. The 1BDE is also trained in disaster relief, having provided assistance to the state of Georgia and its communities.

Whether it is SAR, shelter augmentation, chainsaw operations, traffic control, area security, point of distribution operations, or other needs, the 1BDE is ready to serve!

**1st BDE Area of Operation**

**The “area of operation” (AO) of the 1BD**E is north of I-20, but including areas in Dekalb, Henry, and Rockdale counties that are south of I-20, from the Alabama state line to South Carolina and extending up to North Carolina and Tennessee. This large area is supported by three battalions of the 1BDE. The 2nd Battalion, headquartered in Marietta, is also located in Rome. The 3rd Battalion is headquartered in Winder, and the 4th Battalion is headquartered in Dahlonega. 

**How to Join 1BDE**

**To join the 1BD, please contact SSG Timothy Richardson, lead recruiter for the 1BDE.**

## 2nd Battalion

The 2nd Battalion provides force multipliers for the Georgia National Guard, emergency management agencies, and civil authorities.

**What We Do**

The 2nd Battalion is prepared to augment Army and Air National Guard counterparts during pre-mobilization, annual training, and other special assignments.  When called upon by the Governor, we are ready to support civil authorities in the aftermath of natural disasters, during the pandemic and any time local authorities need a hand.  Our training includes SAR in wilderness and urban environments, opposition forces (OPFOR), point of distribution  operations, area and traffic control, special events, and more.

**Area of Operation**

The Area of Operation (AO) for the 2nd Battalion roughly consists of the counties within the area north of I-20 and west of 400 to the Tennessee border. Soldiers from 2nd Battalion routinely augment and deploy with other GSDF units across the state.

**When and Where Do We Train**

The 2nd Battalion A Company drills third (Charlie) weekend of each month at the National Guard armory in Marietta Ga. The 2nd Battalion Company drills the second (Bravo) weekend of the month at the National Guard armory in Rome, Ga.

## 3rd Battalion

**When We Train**

The 3rd Battalion training occurs one weekend a month, usually the third (Charlie) weekend, but can shift to another weekend based on holiday conflicts. In addition to training drills, 3rd Battalion usually conducts two (2) field training exercises a year, bivouacking in the “woods,” to field test our training results.

**Where We Train**

The 3rd Battalion home training base is the Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF#1) located at the Winder, Ga., airport. This facility supports GAARNG Black Hawk maintenance work and has 24/7 security on site.

**Area of Operation**

The Area of Operation (AO) for the 3BN roughly consists of the counties within the area north of I-20, west to I-285, south of I-85, and east to the South Carolina border. The 3BN also routinely augments other 1 BDE battalions, and provides mission support for other GSDF brigades. 

**What We Do**

Our primary goal is supporting the Georgia Army National Guard. Since 2014, 3BN have provided assistance to the GAANG 178th MP Company based in Monroe, Ga., and the 1-121 Infantry Unit based in Winder, GA. 

While some of those missions were adding additional Soldier support, more recently, 3BN have been involved in their Opposing Force training called OPFORs. These OPFORs allow the GAANG to utilize us as “enemies” to help better train their soldiers for real world missions.

Other METL (Mission Essential Task List) and Soldier skills training includes:
•	Land navigation
•	CPR & First Aid
•	Radio communication
•	Search & Rescue (SAR)

The 3rd Battalion also conducts additional training in relation to disaster relief, in case of hurricanes, tornados, or other weather-related events. This training includes:
•	Chainsaw operations
•	Debris clearing
•	Evacuee shelter assistance
•	Area security
•	Traffic control
•	Search and rescue
•	Points of distribution (POD) operations of essential food supplies & water to citizens in need

If you are willing to serve and live in the 3BN AO, please request to be part of the 3BN at MEPS or with your cadre at IET.

## 4th Battalion

The 4th Battalion is known as the Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) battalion.

**What We Do**

The 4th Battalion specializes in wilderness search and rescue. The 4th Battalion regularly trains to sharpen and extend our skills and capabilities to support that mission. The 4th Battalion is also a force multiplier for TRADOC to guest instruct at SAR II classes and is also certified to host and run a SAR II course.  

While our primary task is SAR, we are also trained and proficient to deploy for all GSDF missions. Those missions include urban SAR, point of distribution operations, and FEMA and GEMA support during natural disasters. The 4th Battalion augments and supports the National Guard troops by providing opposition forces and providing support to local municipalities (from simple traffic control to running entire parades). 

**Area of Operation**

The Area of Operation (AO) for 4BN is centered around the north Georgia mountains and surrounding areas.  However, we have been deployed to locations across Georgia, whenever needed, to augment the National Guard units and serve the citizens of our state.  

**When and Where Do We Train**

The 4BN training weekend is usually the 2nd weekend (Bravo weekend) of the month and annual training can be 3-5 days in duration, depending on the unit level of training that is held for that year (BN or BDE or GSDF-wide).

4BN is officially attached to the University of North Georgia Corps of Cadets (the Boar’s Head Brigade). A large number of the cadets serve in the National Guard while attending the university to graduate and commission as officers in a branch of the US military or in a National Guard unit. The Pine Valley Recreation Center in Dahlonega is the primary drill location for 4BN, but we also drill at the Yonah Preserve and at several locations on the Appalachian Trail.
