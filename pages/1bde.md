# 1st Brigade

# "Boots on the Ground!"



**Mission**

The 1BDE is the “boots on the ground” for the Georgia State Defense Force. The 1BDE is extensively trained in SAR (search and rescue) and land navigation, having provided skilled assistance to local authorities in their efforts to locate lost persons. The 1BDE is also trained in disaster relief, having provided assistance to the state of Georgia and its communities.

Whether it is SAR, shelter augmentation, chainsaw operations, traffic control, area security, point of distribution operations, or other needs, the 1BDE is ready to serve!

**1st BDE Area of Operation**

**The “area of operation” (AO) of the 1BD**E is north of I-20, but including areas in Dekalb, Henry, and Rockdale counties that are south of I-20, from the Alabama state line to South Carolina and extending up to North Carolina and Tennessee. This large area is supported by three battalions of the 1BDE. The 2nd Battalion, headquartered in Marietta, is also located in Rome. The 3rd Battalion is headquartered in Winder, and the 4th Battalion is headquartered in Dahlonega. 

**How to Join 1BDE**

**To join the 1BD, please contact SSG Timothy Richardson, lead recruiter for the 1BDE.**

## 2BN/1BDE

The Force Multipliers for GA National Guard, Emergency Mgmt Agencies & Civil Authorities

**What We Do**

The 2BN is ready to serve the State of Georgia.  Our Soldiers are prepared to augment our Army and Air National Guard counterparts during pre-mobilization, annual training, and other special assignments.  When called upon by the Governor, we are ready to support civil authorities in the aftermath of natural disasters, during the pandemic and any time local authorities need a hand.  Our training includes search and rescue (SAR) in wilderness and urban environments, opposition forces (OPFOR), point of distribution (POD) operations, area and traffic control, special events, and much more.

**Area of Operation**

The Area of Operations (AO) for 2BN roughly consists of the counties within the area north of I-20 & west of 400 to the Tennesseeborder.  Soldiers from 2BN routinely augment and deploy with other GSDF units across the state.

**When & Where Do We Train**

2BN A Company drills third (Charlie) weekend at the National Guard armory located in Marietta Ga.  2BN Company drills second (Bravo) weekend at the National Guard armory located in Rome Ga.  If you're looking to challenge yourself with a wide range of skills and explore all the essential tasks of a GSDF Soldier, 2BN is the place to be!

## 3BN /1BDE

The 3rd Battalion (3BN) is one of the three (3) battalions within the **1st Brigade (1BDE)** of the GSDF.

**When We Train**

The 3rd Battalion training occurs one weekend a month, usually the third (Charlie) weekend, but can shift to another weekend based on holiday conflicts. In addition to training drills, 3rd Battalion usually conducts two (2) field training exercises (FTX) a year, bivouacking in the “woods”, to field test our training results.

**Where We Train**

The 3BN home training base is the Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF#1) located at the Winder, GA airport. This facility supports GAARNG Black Hawk maintenance work and has 24 hour/7 day a week security on site.

**Area of Operation**

The Area of Operations (AO) for the 3BN roughly consists of the counties within the area north of I-20, west to I-285, south of I-85, and East to the SC border. The 3BN also routinely augments other **1BDE BN**s, and mission support for other GSDF **BDEs,** so therefore 3BN Soldiers could provide support anywhere within the State of Georgia.

**What We Do**

Our primary goal is supporting the Georgia Army National Guard. Since 2014, 3BN have provided assistance to the GAANG 178th MP Company based in Monroe, GA, and the 1-121 Infantry Unit based in Winder, GA. 

While some of those missions were adding additional soldier support, more recently, 3BN have been involved in their Opposing Force training called OPFORs. These OPFORs allow the GAANG to utilize us as “enemies” to help better train their soldiers for real world missions.

Other METL (Mission Essential Task List) and Soldier Skills training includes:
•	Land navigation
•	CPR & First Aid
•	Radio communication
•	Search & Rescue (SAR)

The 3BN also conducts additional training in relation to Disaster Relief, in case of hurricanes, tornados, or other weather-related events. This training includes:
•	Chain saw operations
•	Debris clearing
•	Evacuee shelter assistance
•	Area security
•	Traffic control
•	Search & rescue
•	Points of distribution (POD) operations of essential food supplies & water to citizens in need

If you are willing to serve and live in the 3BN AO, please request to be part of the 3BN at MEPS or with your cadre at IET.

## 4BN/1BDE

The 4BN is known as the WSAR (Wilderness Search and Rescue) BN.

**What We Do**

The 4BN specialty is WSAR and we train regularly to sharpen and extend our skills and capabilities to support that mission.  4BN is also a force multiplier for TRADOC to guest instruct at SAR II classes and is also a certified BN to host and run a SAR II course.  While our primary tasking is SAR, we are also trained and proficient to deploy for all GSDF missions.  Those missions include urban SAR, POD operations, FEMA and GEMA support during natural disasters, augmenting and supporting our National Guard troops by providing opposition forces and providing support to local municipalities (from simple traffic control to running entire parades).  The Governor is our Commander-In-Chief but we serve the citizens of Georgia.

**Area of Operation**

The Area of Operations (AO) for 4BN is centered around the North Georgia mountains and surrounding areas.  However, we can be and have been deployed to locations across Georgia whenever needed to augment the National Guard units and serve the citizens of our state.  

**When & Where Do We Train**

4BN training weekend is usually the 2nd weekend (Bravo weekend) of the month and annual training can be 3-5 days in duration, depending on the unit level of training that is held for that year (BN or BDE or GSDF-wide).

4BN is officially attached to the University of North Georgia Corps of Cadets (the Boar’s Head Brigade).  A large number of the cadets serve in the National Guard while attending the university to graduate and commission as officers in a branch of the US military or in a National Guard unit.  The Pine Valley Recreation Center in Dahlonega is the primary drill location for 4BN but we also drill at the Yonah Preserve and at several locations on the Appalachian Trail.
