# 1st Brigade

The 1BDE is the “boots on the ground” for the Georgia State Defense Force in North Georgia. Currently lead by BDE Commander Col Anthony Evangelista.  

**1st BDE’s Mission**

The 1BDE is extensively trained in SAR (search and rescue) and land navigation.  1BDE has provided a large amount of skilled assistance to local authorities in their efforts to locate lost persons.  Disaster relief is also a large part of what the 1BDE is involved with and trains for every year. Whether it is shelter augmentation, chain saw operations, traffic control, SAR, area security, POD (point of distribution) operations or any other needed skill, the 1BDE has always been ready to serve the citizens of the state of Georgia. 

**1st BDE's AO**

The “area of operation” (AO) of the 1BDE is everything north of I-20 but including areas in Dekalb, Henry and Rockdale counties that are south of I-20, from the Alabama state line to South Carolina and extending up to Tennessee and North Carolina. This large area is supported by three battalions of the 1BDE. 2BN headquartered in Marietta with a company also located in Rome. 3BN headquartered in Winder and 4BN headquartered in Dahlonega.

The Area of Operations (AO) for 2BN roughly consists of the counties within the area North of I-20 & West of 400 to the TN border.  Soldiers from 2BN routinely augment and deploy with other GSDF units across the state.
