# 4th Brigade

4th Brigade is Headquartered in Ashburn, Georgia. Our Area of Operation covers all South Georgia from the Alabama Line to the Coast and from Crisp County to Florida.

Over the past decade the soldiers of 4BDE have responded to natural disasters such as Hurricane Mathew, Hurricane Irma Hurricane Michael as well as the 2017 Tornado outbreak.

With the recent response to the Covid-19 pandemic, 4BDE spent 6 weeks packing meals to distribute for families in need. We also worked 7 different PODs to distribute these meals to feed 10,000 families.

4BDE welcomes all interested recruits to contact [MSG William Kearns](mailto:william.kearns@gasdf.us) for any questions you may have or Join 4th Brigade Now!
