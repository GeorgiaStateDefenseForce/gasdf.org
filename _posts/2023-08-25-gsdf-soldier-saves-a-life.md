**On August 23rd, 2023**: 

On a random Wednesday evening, PFC Dennis Pham was working out at his local gym, it was leg day after all, when he happened to see out of the corner of his eye a person doing some 'strange pushups'.  PFC Pham says, "I first noticed someone doing what seemed like strange pushups and then realized they were more like chest compressions".  He jumped off the treadmill to investigate further and found a man in his mid-50s, blue in the face, gasping for air and without a pulse.  

Thanks to his GSDF training, he responded quickly and with authority.  PFC Pham had just, a few weeks previously, reviewed his Basic Life Support (BLS) training while attending the GSDF's First-Aid Specialist Course.  The First-Aid Specialist Course is an entry level course designed to bring soldiers up to speed on life saving drills and to prepare them for follow up courses that will eventually lead to a medic designation or a career in the 132nd Medical Battalion. 

PFC Pham and some other good samaritans continued CPR for over 10 minutes while deploying AED shocks at least 4 times.  "We had to cut his shirt off and I applied the pads in the appropriate places... We then followed the prompts from the device..."

> PFC Pham said, "Chest compressions are hard, I had to help others keep up the pace when they slowed down.... "

GSDF's motto is Parati Servire, meaning "Ready to Serve".  As Georgians, we are grateful PFC Pham was ready to serve and there are many more like him in the GSDF ready to serve the citizens of Georgia.
