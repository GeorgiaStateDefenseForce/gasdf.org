The members of the 1st Brigade of the Georgia State Defense Force have won the McGuinn Award for the fifth time since the award was begun in 2008.

The McGuinn Award is a point based unit competition intended to improve morale, recruitment, and retention. The award is named after Brigadier General Michael McGuinn who served from 2005 to 2008 as GSDF commander.
