**CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, February 7, 2016** – Brig. Gen. Tom Danielson, Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) commander, presented Capt. Mac McElroy and Staff Sgt. Richard Legrand, both of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, with the Meritorious Service Medal during the February Chief of Staff meeting. They were awarded the medal for sustained performance of outstanding service.

On September 13, 2015, while overseeing Duty Level Training, Staff Sgt. Legrand came to the aid of a fellow GSDF soldier who collapsed on the field. Detecting no heartbeat, Staff Sgt. Legrand and Capt. McElroy immediately started to perform CPR and continued until Paramedics arrived on the scene and were able to stabilize their comrade for transport to the hospital where he made a full recovery. McElroy and Legrand’s selfless act and ability to remain calm and professional throughout the ordeal exemplifies the best in GSDF soldiers.
