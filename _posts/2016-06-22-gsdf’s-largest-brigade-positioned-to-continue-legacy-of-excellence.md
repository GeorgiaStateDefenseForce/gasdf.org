**CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, Georgia, May 15, 2016** – A recent ceremony marked a change of command for the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) 1st Brigade, positioning GSDF’s largest brigade to continue its legacy of excellence. The command was transferred to Col. Sam Peng from Col. Brad Bryant, who ended his distinguished GSDF service in retirement.

“You came onboard when the country needed you,” GSDF Commanding Officer Brig. Gen. Tom Danielson said to Col. Bryant, who joined the GSDF in 2001, shortly after the tragic events of 9/11. “Thank you for your professionalism and dedication to the 1st Brigade and to the GSDF, as a whole.”

Brig. Gen. Danielson recognized Col. Bryant and Col. Peng for their outstanding service. He also acknowledged contributions from the 1st Brigade. “You’re a very important part of what goes on here,” Brig. Gen. Danielson said, in addressing 1st Brigade Soldiers standing in formation during the ceremony. “You’re a very important part of something larger than yourself. It’s why we’re all here.”

Soldiers, family, and friends attended the ceremony, which highlighted the careers of both officers.
