The Senate and House of Representatives adopted resolutions recognizing the men and women of the Georgia Department of Defense. The resolutions included several specific references to the Georgia State Defense Force. The Senate resolution, sponsored by Senators Jack Hill, Ed Harbison, Mike Dugan, Bill Cowsert, Hunter Hill, and Jeff Mullis, recognized “the selfless and heroic actions of the Georgia National Guard.” The House of Representatives resolution, sponsored by Representative John P. Yates, commended “the men and women of the Georgia National Guard for their strength, leadership, and courage in their willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.” As always, the GSDF stands “Ready To Serve” and is grateful to the members of the General Assembly for their support. Please see below for links to the resolutions.
