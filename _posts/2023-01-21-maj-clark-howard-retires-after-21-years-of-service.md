Because he encouraged Georgia citizens to join either the GSDF or the Georgia National Guard, both organizations highly regard his commitment.

Georgia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Carden Jr., GSDF Commanding General Brig. Gen. Mark D. Gelhardt Sr., and military personnel from both the National Guard and the GSDF joined Maj. Howard’s family and friends in attendance at his retirement ceremony.

# GSDF Service

After the events of September 11, 2001, Maj. Howard joined the GSDF.

Maj. Howard served as a Senior Public Affairs Officer. He used the airwaves to tout the GSDF’s mission. He also made numerous public appearances at community events throughout the years. He frequently joined virtual GSDF orientation meetings—where potential recruits throughout the state met him online.

Maj. Howard also volunteered for a number of military missions, including Hurricane Katrina and the “snowmageddon” storms.

“For 21 years Clark has been providing volunteer service to the state of Georgia,” said GSDF Commanding General Brig. Gen. Mark D. Gelhardt Sr. “He has done a fantastic job for the State Defense Force.”

# Awards

Brig. Gen. Thomas M. Carden Jr. presented Maj. Howard with the James Edward Oglethorpe (Olgethorpe) Award. James Edward Oglethorpe was a British Soldier, member of Parliament, philanthropist, and founder of the colony of Georgia. The Oglethorpe Award recognizes those who distinguished themselves with outstanding and exceptional service over an extended period of time.

Clark Howard has “more than earned it,’’ said Maj. Gen. Carden. “This business is about serving a cause larger than yourself. I can’t think of a better standard-bearer for a leader that spends every day of his life serving a cause larger than himself.”

Maj. Howard (promoted from Captain during the ceremony) received a Georgia commendation from the office of Brian P. Kemp. The award read, in part:

“Through his efforts, the GSDF has grown . . . with an estimated one-third of the GSDF (F)orce being recruited due to his tireless advocacy ad promotion; In addition to his service Caption Howard has dedicated himself to bettering his community, investing his time and resources in ventures, such as Habitat for Humanity and Clark’s Christmas Kids . . .”

The GSDF presented a plaque. The Public Affairs Office (PAO) presented a military musket and a certificate bearing the names of PAO personnel past and present.

During the ceremony, Maj. Howard also received numerous other medals and certificates.
