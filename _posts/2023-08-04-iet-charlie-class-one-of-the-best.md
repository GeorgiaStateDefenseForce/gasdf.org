**MARIETTA ARMORY, Marietta, Georgia, December 6, 2015 -** With family and friends looking on, the newest members of the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) graduated from Initial Entry Training (IET). The twelve recruits of IET Charlie Class marched crisply into the Georgia Army National Guard 248th Medical Company armory under the direction of Sgt. Jason Tweedell from the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). After enthusiastically reciting the Soldier’s Creed, the GSDF’s newest Soldiers were pinned with their ranks by Capt. Scott Thompson of TRADOC as their duty assignments were read out loud.
