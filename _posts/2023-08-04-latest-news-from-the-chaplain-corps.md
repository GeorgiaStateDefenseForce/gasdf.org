By CH (CPT), Spencer Haygood, Command Chaplain:

**TRAINING:** For the second consecutive year, GSDF Chaplains have been invited to and have taken part in the GADOD Joint Chaplain Corps Annual Training held each April.

The topic of focus in 2015 was “Ethics,” with the keynote speaker being LTC Pete Kilner, the Academy Professor of Philosophy at West Point. His very helpful block of instruction was entitled, “A Moral Justification of Killing in War.” Other presenters included CH (CPT) Jon Pirtle of the GAARNG, John M. Njoroge of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries, and CH (MG) Doug Carver, retired, former Army Chief of Chaplains.

The focus of the 2016 training was “World Religions,” including blocks of instruction by LTC Stephen Tucker (on HRF OPS/COOP TRNG), Dr. John Azumah of Columbia Theological Seminary (on Islam), SFC Luke Hendricks of the Office of the Joint Chaplain, National Guard Bureau (on Domestic Operations), Dr. Barbara Lattimore and CH (MAJ) Leslie Nelson (on Strong Bonds), and CH (CPT) Spencer Haygood, GSDF Command Chaplain (on the Challenges of Pluralism).

**NEW 1BDE CHAPLAIN:** CH (CPT) Timothy Watts is the newest member of the GSDF Chaplain Corps and is now assigned to the 1BDE. CH Watts is a former Army CPT with nine years service and is a Chinook helicopter pilot who now serves as Rector at St. Mary &amp; St. Martha of Bethany Episcopal Church in Buford, GA. Welcome, sir, to the GSDF and to the Chaplain Corps!

**NEW TRADOC CHAPLAIN:** CH (1LT) Kenny Weaver (whom many may know) has returned to the GSDF after a brief time away and is now assigned to TRADOC. Welcome back, sir! Glad you are part of the team.

**BIBLE STUDY:** Each Wednesday from 1130-1230 hours, the Chapel is open for Bible study led by Chaplains of the GAARNG and GSDF. Currently, CH Haygood, GSDF, is leading a six-week study in Psalm 23 for GAARNG and GSDF soldiers as well as civilian personnel on base. This is one more aspect of the GSDF Chaplain Corps being wrapped into the service/ministry rotation with GAARNG Chaplains.
