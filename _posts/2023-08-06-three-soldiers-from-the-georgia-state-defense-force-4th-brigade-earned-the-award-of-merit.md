On May 20, 2023, during airborne training in Waynesville, Ohio, (training not GSDF-related), a Laotian Airborne Soldier had a malfunction with his parachute and was blown three miles off course. Rescue efforts by the civilian employees of the drop zone failed to locate the Soldier. Following three hours of searching, nightfall rolled and a dangerous thunderstorm loomed ahead.

Relying upon various GSDF trainings, 1st Lt. Travis Bryan, Master Sgt. Drew Kearns, Pvt. Joseph Legg initiated a separate search for the Soldier. They obtained two-way radios, enlisted two Laotian Soldiers as interpreters, jumped in two cars, and headed out into the night. Within an hour, they found the missing soldier, who had been hanging 15 feet up in a tree, beyond a densely thick hedge row. 

After several attempts to break through the hedge row, they finally reached the Laotian paratrooper and immediately assessed him for injuries. They then extricated him from the tree and reunited him with his comrades. 

The Laotian Award of Merit is the fourth highest award given by the nation of Laos and is awarded for "Setting oneself apart from form his/her comrades by outstanding non-combat meritorious achievement or service."

The GASDF Soldiers were pinned by Major General Buford Compton of the Royal Lao Airborne.
