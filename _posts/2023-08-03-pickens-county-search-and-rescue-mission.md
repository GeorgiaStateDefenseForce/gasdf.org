Several elements of the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) were activated on Saturday, October 22 at the request of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. The request was made in order to support a search and rescue mission to locate a missing person. The missing person was last seen on a hike on Sharp Mountain in Pickens County. In addition to the GSDF, the Georgia State Patrol, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the Georgia Department of Corrections, and deputies from the Cherokee, Gilmer, and Pickens County Sheriffâ€™s Office participated in the search. The multi-agency search covered several hundred acres and was conducted over several days.
