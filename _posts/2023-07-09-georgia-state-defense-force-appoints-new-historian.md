Recently, the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) appointed a new Historian. Col. James H. "Jim" Moore was appointed Historian on February 5, 2022. In addition to serving as the GSDF Historian, Col Moore also serves as commander of the Ready Reserve battalion.

Col. Moore said that the mission and purpose of the Historian is, “to help instill a sense of history and 'Esprit de corps’ in the GSDF.” Among Col. Moore’s goals as the Historian is to have a display tracing the history of the GSDF beginning with General James Edward Oglethorpe, founder of the colony of Georgia, to the present day. Col. Moore has a long-term goal of a museum dedicated to the GSDF. When asked how GSDF Soldiers can help, Col. Moore said, “Soldiers can help by sharing history, and donating/loaning various items from all time periods relating to Georgia's militia, State Guard, State Defense Force. All who do will be given credit.”

Outside of the GSDF, Col. Moore is a musician, author, and the pastor of Gwinnett Baptist Tabernacle, where he has served for 22 years. A graduate of Florida International University, Col. Moore enjoys research and visiting military museums. His interests include history, archeology, and aviation. Col. Moore has been married for almost 45 years to the former Julia Lee Baxley and they have six children, and ten grandchildren.

If you have items to donate or loan, please contact Col. Moore at his GSDF email address.
