Fort Gordon, Augusta, Georgia, October 4, 2015 – The Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) was recently activated to support hurricane relief efforts near Augusta, Georgia. Hurricane Joaquin has been relentlessly pounding the eastern United States for the past several days; as a result, numerous areas have experienced severe flooding.

GSDF Soldiers, working alongside Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) Soldiers, filled 8,000 sandbags and loaded them onto eight flatbed trailers. The sandbags will be used to create a water buffer to control flooding in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Over 100 GSDF and GAARNG Soldiers supported the relief activities.
