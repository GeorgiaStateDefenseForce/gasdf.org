**Unique Mission**

Sometimes our call to service is not in uniform.  Sometimes we need to play the role of a victim or even an active shooter.  As is the case in this mission for Cobb County and surrounding counties where we had the opportunity to help them exercise an active shooter scenario.  

All troops enjoyed getting the make-up and playing victim as well as learning how our fellow agencies handle these scenarios.  

**Future**

If we can help your EMA with training: from force on force all the way to playing victim, reach out to your local State Guard Rep to help!
