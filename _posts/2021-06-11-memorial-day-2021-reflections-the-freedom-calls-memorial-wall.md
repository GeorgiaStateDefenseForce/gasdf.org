On May 27, 2021, Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Lt. Col. Steve Knezo reunited with his friend and colleague, Georgia Army National Guard Command Sgt. Maj. (Ret) James Nelson Jr., for the Georgia National Guard Memorial Day Observance at the Freedom Calls Memorial Wall<strong>,</strong> Clay National Guard Center, Marietta, Ga.

The wall commemorates Georgia National Guard Soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war on terrorism Photos of the fallen line the Memorial Wall.

Lt. Col. Knezo, who currently serves as GSDF Deputy Staff Judge Advocate, enlisted in the GSDF in November 2001. As a practicing attorney, then Assistant Judge Advocate Maj. Knezo led the effort to obtain 501(c)3 public charity status for the Freedom Calls Memorial Foundation, which constructed the Memorial Wall in 2014. Securing public charity status was crucial because the Memorial Wall could not have been legally financed with public funds.

Lt. Col. Knezo then worked as a project manager and liaison between the Freedom Calls Memorial Foundation, its vendors, the National Guard, and the families of the fallen. He contributed the inspirational statement that appears on the granite plaque at the center of the Memorial Wall: “<em>To the Fallen – In grateful memory of the men and women of the Georgia National Guard who gave their lives in the name of peace and freedom during the Global War on Terrorism. We shall remember them</em>.”

Command Sgt. Maj Nelson served on active duty during the Global War on Terrorism. He currently serves as Executive Director of the Freedom Calls Memorial Foundation, Inc.
