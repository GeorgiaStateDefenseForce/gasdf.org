# Hurricane Season 2022

The Georgia State Defense Force Joins the Georgia National Guard and Various Agencies in Training Exercise

By Capt. Beverly Shepard
Col. Lan Skalla contributed to this report.


In preparing for the 2022 hurricane season, the Georgia Department of Defense conducted a hurricane exercise (rehearsal of concept) earlier this year. The Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) participated in the exercise held at Clay National Guard Center, Marietta, Ga.  
During this training, participants shared how their agencies and organizations would assist the state in the event of a hurricane. This information helped ensure readiness and interagency synchronization for the 2022 hurricane season (June 1-November 30).

Georgia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Carden Jr. (photo below) spoke during the hurricane preparation training exercise. GSDF Commanding General Brig. Gen. Mark D. Gelhardt Sr. joined Maj. Gen. Carden and other leaders at the command table.

Georgiaâ€™s Joint Staff, the Georgia Air National Guard, the Georgia Army National Guard, and the GSDF gave briefings on protocols for a hurricane response. Assistant Chief of Staff G3 (Plans and Operations) COL Lan Skalla, who briefed for the GSDF, was among those from the GSDF who attended.

Along with the Georgia Department of Defense, other participants included the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency, the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the Georgia Department of Public Health, the American Red Cross, and various state partners.
