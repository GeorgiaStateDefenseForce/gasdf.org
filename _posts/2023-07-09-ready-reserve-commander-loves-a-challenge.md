**PAO**: What is Ready Reserve?

**Lt. Col. Rodriguez:** Soldiers in the Ready Reserve are unable to maintain full-time active status for various reasons. However, they can be available during emergency call-ups. Ready Reserve also provides entry in the GSDF for prior military service applicants with valuable skills, who possess rank for which there is no available GSDF Table of Allowance Vacancy.

**PAO**: How do Ready Reserve Soldiers serve the GSDF?

**Lt. Col. Rodriguez**: The Ready Reserve promotes the best interests of the GSDF in that the Ready Reserve allows forÂ retention, in an organized structure, of trained and skilled Soldiers.

**PAO**: What is your vision for Ready Reserve?

**Lt. Col. Rodriguez**: As Commander of Ready Reserve, my vision is to establish teamwork. With healthy teamwork comes confidence in the personnel who form the unit. I believe that being an officer/noncommissioned officer assigned in any capacity to work with troops is a privilege. One should accept that responsibility with a determination to succeed.
