Soldiers of the Third Battalion / First Brigade trained day and night at their recent Field Training Exercise (FTX) at Yellow River Park, a 566 acre Gwinnett County Park. By day: One-Rope Bridge Crossing and Map Building. By night: Map Reading and Land Navigation. The battalion took advantage of the diverse terrain of the park to practice the skills needed for real-life missions. The FTX was to equip soldiers with the skills they need to be ready for mission events that they ultimately know they could be called out to act upon. ALWAYS Ready to Serve.
