**Ft Stewart, Georgia, August 21-28, 2015, By 2nd LT Ted Burzynski –** Soldiers of the Georgia Army National Guard (GAARNG) and Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) and Airmen from the Georgia Air National Guard participated in an eight-day State-wide Marksmanship Clinic.

This clinic was the first ever held by the Georgia Army National Guard. The goal of this clinic was to provide a venue for Georgia Guard personnel to improve their marksmanship skills.

For eight days, instructors led by Sgt. 1st Class Jakob Raven (GAARNG) of the Georgia Garrison Training Center (GGTC) worked to improve Soldier‘s basic marksmanship skills across a wide array of weapons and techniques. These ranged from pistols, rifles, shotguns to crew-served weapons.

Fifteen Soldiers from the GSDF led by Maj. Don Lankford, Executive Officer, 5th Brigade assisted in the marksmanship clinic. GSDF Soldiers served as range safety officers, coaches, and support personnel on the ranges; manning ammo points, cleaning weapons and scoring targets.
