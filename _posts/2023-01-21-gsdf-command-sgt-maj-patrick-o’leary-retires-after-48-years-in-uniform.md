During a retirement ceremony at the Ellenwood Readiness Center, Ellenwood Ga., Command Sgt. Maj. O’Leary received the prestigious James Edward Oglethorpe Award, along with numerous gifts and certificates.

“It was my honor to be part of a great Soldier’s career and retirement,” said GSDF Commanding General Brig. Gen. Mark D. Gelhardt Sr. “CSM O’Leary was an outstanding senior noncommissioned officer and my right-hand Senior NCO for several years. CSM O’Leary’s well-deserved retirement—after so many years in uniform, both on active duty, as a Vietnam War veteran, and as the CSM of the Georgia State Defense Force—is a career that all should look at and want to emulate. CSM O’Leary is a true professional soldier who has led the way for all of us and has set standards that we should all try to meet.”

“He’s a true example of an outstanding NCO,” said retired Brig. Gen. Lou Coroso, former GSDF Deputy Commanding General. “It was a privilege to serve with him in the GSDF for over 20 years.”

In addition, Command Sgt. Maj. O’Leary supported the headquarters Soldier of the Year (SOY) competition. As GSDF Command Sergeant Major, he chaired every SOY board.

“You certainly had to know your stuff because Command Sgt. Maj. O’Leary could smell nonsense a mile away, and he would call you out on it,” said retired Sgt. 1st Class Kara Kirby, the only GSDF Soldier known to have been selected for both Soldier of the Year and Noncommissioned Soldier of the Year awards.
