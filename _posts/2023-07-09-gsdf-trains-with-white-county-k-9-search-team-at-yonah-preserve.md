WCCERT/SAR Leader and K9 Handler Donna Frady and Lead Flanker Chuck Blaine led the training. They provided 4BN/1BDE Soldiers an overview of the various types of SAR K9s, the formation of a Flanker Support Team, and how dogs detect scent.

The WCCERT/SAR led 4BN/1BDE Soldiers in a training field exercise, applying the fundamental techniques of K9 search and rescue operations. Soldiers worked in teams to search, through a wilderness environment, for participants who were designated as “missing” for the purposes of the training exercise. The individual and collective mission essential task list (METL) which Soldiers used during the exercise included search and rescue, land navigation, and communications tasks.

**The K9 Flanker Team**

A K9 flanker support team is made up of 3-4 trained people: a K9 handler, a communication flanker, and two navigator flankers. Soldiers had the opportunity to serve in the flanking roles, moving behind the handler in a straight-line formation. This hands-on exercise allowed Soldiers to learn the structure of a K9 search team, the different types of search dogs that can be used in a search mission, and ways GSDF troops could successfully work together with a K9 unit during a real-life rescue mission.\
\
Canine search teams are trained to work in a variety of settings and can be an integral resource during an emergency search event. Given their heightened sense of smell, dogs can possess up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses (humans only average about 5 million). K9 handlers introduce an uncontaminated scent article (usually the inside sole of a shoe belonging to the missing person) to the tracking dog to begin the search process.

During this exercise, WCCERT/SAR brought their primary SAR K9, “Leigha,” a six-year-old Shepherd- boxer mix, as well as a puppy-in-training, “Mae,” a German Shepherd. Dogs must be licensed and certified through the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HSA) to participate in SAR-related events in Georgia.\
\
“We learned how we would work with their dogs, and we learned how integrating with their K9 unit would work. We were able to walk through some of those scenarios,” Capt. Ken Mayger explained. “In addition, we provided the opportunity for their K9 handlers to train a newer dog. So, it was advantageous for us and good training for their dogs."\

**Coordination and Participation**\
\
“There was good coordination and participation between both CERT and GSDF,” said Leah Torregiano, White County CERT Coordinator and Emergency Management Agency Specialist. “I think we learned a lot, as far as being able to work together on a real search if we got called out together. We have worked separately on searches, but we never worked jointly together."\
\
For one Soldier, this training exercise reinforced his reason for serving in the GSDF.\
\
“I wanted to get out in the woods, stay active, and more importantly, help people and give back to the community,” said Pvt. George Taylor, who joined the GSDF earlier this year.
