**CLAY NATIONAL GUARD CENTER, Marietta, Georgia, April 27, 2016** – Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) Soldiers were among more than 1,000 people who attended a recent Cobb Chamber After Hours event that honored the military and fostered military-civilian relationships.

The GSDF made a strong showing. Soldiers manned an information/recruitment table, assisted with traffic flow, and carried out other logistics.

“We’re proud to be a part of this event,” said Chief Warrant Officer 4 Garrard, GSDF

officer in charge (OIC) for the event. “I’m also proud of the professionalism and enthusiasm our Soldiers brought to various interactions and activities throughout the evening.”

The Cobb Chamber and the 94th Airlift Wing, an Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force (located at Dobbins Air Reserve Base), hosted the event. In addition to the GSDF, invitees included the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Navy, the Georgia Department of Defense, and the Civil Air Patrol. The Honorary Commanders, a cooperative effort of the Cobb Chamber, Clay National Guard Center, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, the U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. Navy, was represented, as well.

“It fosters relationships between the military community and the business community,” said Amy Selby, vice president, marketing and communications for the Cobb Chamber. “The civilian community can learn what happens here. A lot of people don’t know what happens behind the gate.”

In addition to engaging with military personnel, attendees gained close-up views of a U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopter and other aircraft on hand.

Since 2014, the Cobb Chamber has participated as an event partner. Elizabeth Easton, military programs manager for the chamber, said annual event attendance had grown steadily, with this year marking the largest attendance of the past three years.

“It certainly has been a rewarding experience for all involved,” Chief Warrant Officer 4 Garrard said of the event. “The GSDF has received positive response from participating in these types of activities, and we look forward to continuing our service as a valued community contributor.”
